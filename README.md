### 3. Construct a string of length N using the first K letters of an alphabet. The cost to construct the string is the number of instances where pairs of characters match in position and order. For example, to construct a string from the first K = 2 letters of the English alphabet that is N = 4 characters long, two of the many possible results are 'abab' for a cost of 1 and 'abba' for a cost of 0. Construct the strings for the following test cases to minimize cost. Select the list of answers that matches the costs.
- a. **12 16**
- b. 12 15
- c. 0116
- d. 02 15

**Answer: a. 12 16**

### 4. The string S is initially empty. The following can be performed on S any number of times:
- Append any character to S for a cost of 5 points.
- Copy any substring of S that ends at the current rightmost character and append it to S for a cost of 5 points.
  What is the minimum cost to construct the string "abhihbhihi"?
- a. **35**
- b. 30
- c. 25
- d. 20

**Answer: a. 35**

### 5. What is the difference between augmented reality and virtual reality?
- a. There is no difference.
- b. **Augmented reality blends the virtual world into the real world, and the virtual world is an imaginary world around the person.**
- c. Virtual reality is only through wearable technology, and augmented reality is only through apps.
- d. Augmented reality is an educational tool, and virtual reality is for leisure.

**Answer: b. Augmented reality blends the virtual world into the real world, and the virtual world is an imaginary world around the person.**

### 6. Which of the following is the best explanation of AR spatial computing?
- a. It's a process to capture the environment of the user to make a 3D virtual world.
- b. It's a method to make devices learn about the environment of the user.
- c. **The process of using digital technology to make devices interact seamlessly in a three-dimensional world using augmented reality.**
- d. It's a machine learning method to understand the user's environment better.

**Answer: c. The process of using digital technology to make devices interact seamlessly in a three-dimensional world using augmented reality.**

### 7. Which function returns the arc sine in the range [-pi/2, +pi/2] radians?
- a. arcsin()
- b. **asin()**
- c. sin()
- d. donkey()

**Answer: b. asin()**

### 8. Which of the following is correct?
- a. ARkit works for both iOS and Android devices.
- b. ARcore only works on devices that have Tensor SOC.
- c. **ARkit and ARcore both can provide a markerless AR experience.**
- d. ARkit only works on devices from iOS 10 and Core A8 processor.

**Answer: c. ARkit and ARcore both can provide a markerless AR experience.**

### 9. If Array is used to implement a queue, which operations would be worst affected?
- a. Clear/Empty
- b. **Deletion**
- c. **Accessing**
- d. **Both B and C**

**Answer: d. Both B and C (Deletion and Accessing)**

### 10. Suppose you have an array `arr[]={13,2,9,10,54,21)`. You want to make a min-heap using the elements of this array. What will be the left child of the root? In Min heap, child nodes are greater than parent nodes, and this property is recursively true.
- a. **2**
- b. Only 3
- c. Only 9
- d. 3 or 9

**Answer: a. 2**

### 11. Suppose you are given an array of size 10. You want to delete the 5th element (from the start of the array). Which of the following approaches is correct?
- a. **Move each of the last 5 elements (i.e., elements from the 6th index to 10th index) one index to the left.**
- b. Move each of the last 5 elements (i.e., elements from the 10th index to 6th index) one index to the right.
- c. Change the value of the 5th element to 0.
- d. All of them are correct.

**Answer: a. Move each of the last 5 elements (i.e., elements from the 6th index to 10th index) one index to the left.**
